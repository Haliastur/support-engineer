* Dig through server logs to troubleshoot a customer's website behavior
* Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
* Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
* Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
* Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product
* Manage a support team
* Find and recruit teammates for the support team
* Suggest and champion improvements to the product and workflow to your colleagues in and out of support
* Help train and onboard new support teammates

* Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers

* Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup

### What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?

### What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)

### Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.

### Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

### Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.

### Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?

### Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users

### A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

### (optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?
